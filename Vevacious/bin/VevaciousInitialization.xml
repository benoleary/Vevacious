  <!-- hom4ps2_dir is where the executable hom4ps2 is. absolute paths such as
       /home/hom4ps2/ can be used. -->

  <!-- homotopy_type is 1 for polyhedral homotopy or 2 for linear homotopy.
       actually, for generic QFT potentials, linear homotopy is probably the
       faster option. -->

  <!-- imaginary_tolerance is the tolerance for imaginary parts of VEVs found
       as solutions to the tree-level tadpole equations, since it is possible
       that a numerical precision error could lead to what should be an exact
       cancellation leaving behind a small imaginary part. it is in units of
       GeV, as the other dimensionful values are assumed so since that is how
       they are in the SLHA standard. -->

  <!-- python_wrapper is which Python wrapper for MINUIT to use. originally
       Vevacious required PyMinuit specifically, but now IMinuit can be used
       instead, which is probably preferable, as PyMinuit has been abandoned by
       its author. the choice here is either PYMINUIT or IMINUIT, but is not
       case-sensitive (e.g. iminuit or PyMinuit will also be accepted). -->
  <python_wrapper>
  PYMINUIT
  </python_wrapper>

  <!-- model_file is where the loop-corrected potential stuff as written by
       SARAH is. absolute paths such as /home/vevacious/MyModel/MyModel.vin can
       be used. -->
  <model_file>
  ./MyModel.vin
  </model_file>

  <!-- slha_file is where the Lagrangian parameters in SLHA format are.
       absolute paths such as /home/spheno/MyModel/SPheno.spc.MyModel can be
       used. -->
  <slha_file>
  ./MyParameters.slha.out
  </slha_file>

  <!-- output is where the loop-corrected minimum, as found by PyMinuit
       starting from the HOM4PS2 extrema, should be written. absolute paths
       such as /home/vevacious/MyModel/MyResult.vout can be used. -->
  <result_file>
  ./MyResult.vout

  <!-- saddle_nudges is the comma-separated list of nudges in GeV that should
       be used to nudge PyMinuit off any saddle points where it has come to
       rest. -->
  <saddle_nudges>
  1.0, 5.0, 20.0
  </saddle_nudges>

  <!-- ct_path is the path to where pathDeformation.py & tunneling1D.py are
       found. absolute paths such as /home/cosmotransitions/ can be used. -->

  ./CosmoTransitions/

  <!-- roll_tolerance is the tolerance for whether extrema are identified with
       each other. If roll_tolerance is for example 0.05, then extrema A and B
       are considered to be both at the same extremum within numerical errors
       if the length of the vector of VEV differences is less than 0.05 * the
       length of the longer of the 2 vectors of VEVs. E.g. if A is
       vd = 24.42, vu = 245.0 and B is vd = 24.39, vu = 242.7, the length of A
       is 246.2140, the length of B is 243.9225, so the longer length is
       246.2140; the length of their difference is 2.300196 which is less than
       0.05 * 246.2140, so A & B are considered to be the same extremum. (This
       is important to avoid attempting calculating the tunneling time from the
       input VEVs to what should be exactly the same point, that was just not
       found exactly due to numerical issues.) -->
  <roll_tolerance>
  0.1

  <!-- lifetime_threshold is the fraction of the age of the known Universe used
       as a threshold for whether a parameter point is denoted as short-lived
       or long-lived by comparison with its calculated tunneling time at zero
       temperature. The default of 0.217 (about 3 gigayears) corresponds to a
       survival probability of about 1% assuming a Poisson distribution. -->
  <lifetime_threshold>
  0.217
  </lifetime_threshold>
  
  <!-- thermal_survival_threshold is the fraction used as a threshold for
       whether a parameter point is denoted as having a low or high probability
       to survive thermal tunneling. -->
