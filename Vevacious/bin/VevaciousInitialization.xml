  <!-- roll_tolerance is the tolerance for whether extrema are identified with
       each other. If roll_tolerance is for example 0.05, then extrema A and B
       are considered to be both at the same extremum within numerical errors
       if the length of the vector of VEV differences is less than 0.05 * the
       length of the longer of the 2 vectors of VEVs. E.g. if A is
       vd = 24.42, vu = 245.0 and B is vd = 24.39, vu = 242.7, the length of A
       is 246.2140, the length of B is 243.9225, so the longer length is
       246.2140; the length of their difference is 2.300196 which is less than
       0.05 * 246.2140, so A & B are considered to be the same extremum. (This
       is important to avoid attempting calculating the tunneling time from the
       input VEVs to what should be exactly the same point, that was just not
       found exactly due to numerical issues.) -->

  <!-- quartic_time, direct_time, deformed_time: the fraction of the age of the
       Universe (taken to be 10^41/GeV) which is considered to be long enough
       that the calculation just performed is sufficient for determining the
       stability of the parameter point's input vacuum. these are only relevant
       if the input minimum was not the deepest minimum found.

       1st the quartic_time calculation is performed, and if the upper bound on
       the lifetime is above the given value for quartic_time, then the
       direct_time calculation is performed, and if the upper bound on the
       lifetime is above the given value for direct_time, then the
       deformed_time calculation is performed. For example, if the upper bound
       on the lifetime from the quartic calculation was
       0.0000143 * (10^41/GeV), and quartic_time was 0.2, since 0.0000143 is
       less than 0.2, the slower, fuller calculations of the lifetime are
       skipped.  -->

  <!-- quartic_time: if positive, a quartic polynomial is fitted to a straight
       line in VEV space between the true and false vacua and the thin-wall
       approximation by Sidney Coleman is used to get an upper bound on the
       lifetime. -->

       recommended to be left off, indicated by a negative value. -->

       in VEV space between the true and false vacua to get an upper bound on
       the lifetime. -->
  <direct_time> 0.1 </direct_time>
  <!-- deformed_time: if positive, CosmoTransitions is used, allowing it to
       find the most efficient deformed path in VEV space between the true and
       false vacua to get an estimate of the lifetime (not an upper bound in
       this case). -->
